## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **ICC WT20 2024 cricket dataset** to extract meaningful insights and measure key performance indicators (KPIs) for teams and players. By using advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard that visualizes crucial aspects of the cricket matches and helps with data-driven decision-making. The tools used for analysis and visualization include **Power BI**, **SQL Server**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**.

## ⚙️ Problem Definition

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the ICC WT20 2024 cricket matches to derive valuable insights and identify trends in the data. Key areas of focus include:

- **Team Performance**: Understanding the performance of different teams in terms of wins, losses, net run rate, etc.
- **Player Performance**: Evaluating individual players' contributions, including runs scored, wickets taken, and other critical metrics.
- **Match Outcomes**: Analyzing factors that influence the match results, including toss decisions, batting/bowling first, etc.

The project will provide a comprehensive view of tournament progress and performance through visual reports and dashboards.
